    # This script is used to allow the llm to display a icon 5x10 symbol infront of the number. 
    For the number value and a 5x5 icon after the number use the other two scripts.

    * No changes are required for any of the settings below for this script to work,
    but your specific LLM integration may need some fine-tuning. To do that, adjust
    the prompts sent to the LLM.

    * **Make sure to expose the script to Assist after creating it.**

    * **Make sure to give the script a clear description.** An example can be found
    below.

    There are several variables available which are described below.
